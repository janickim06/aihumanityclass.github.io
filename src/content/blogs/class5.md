To include an image, store the image file in src/content/static/images/. Then, use
<img src="/images/humanitylogo.png" width=80% alt="This is the course logo"></img>

If you have other files to include, put them in static/docs.

You shouldn't need to change the layouts or other files, but if you want to improve them without breaking things, that's fine.
