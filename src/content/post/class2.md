## Schedule

You should be in one of the on-line discussion groups now, and should have received (or will soon receive) a message from your TA to start discussion there.

Check the [Team Schedule](/schedule) to be sure you know your Table Team's upcoming responbilities, and [Readings for Week 2](/readings2).

## Links

I've talked about several of the themes from today in other places. You can see videos from a 2014 cs4414: Operating Systems course here: [_Invent the Future!_](https://rust-class.org/class-23-invent-the-future.html) (that talk was in 2014 and I make some predictions targeting the 15-year future in 2029, so we're getting pretty close to see how badly I did...) A more recent version is: [_Jobs for Humans, 2030-2045_](https://youtu.be/n1oVRhRatmE?si=o4ZxT5_W3sT4nCcy) from TEDxChantilly.
